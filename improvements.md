## Checkout System - Possible Improvements
- Once the offer is selected, the total amount is dyanamically updated with the offer applied. In the current form, the offer is applied to the total only after clicking "checkout" button.
- The output in the form of a proper tax-invoice.
- The option to change the price of the item. Currently the price of the items are hard coded.
